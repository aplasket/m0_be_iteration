# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
each method is helpful when you want to parse out information within an array. It could be helpful in mass communications/emails to a client list of names where you want to personalize the "dear #{client_name}, ..." Or could be especially helpful with conditionals, where if, let's say you have 100 elements, and want to print out only the ones that match a certain condition. Rather than sifting through each element to group data points, you could run an each file to pull out specific conditions.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
learning and remembering commands! It took me a while to figure out how to run the code today and that's ok. But know that I know, I can better ulitize running code more frequently to see if the adds and commits I'm working on, actually run successfully!
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this assignment?
I had just come off the big arrays assignment so it was a lot faster to understand how to check the code frequently. This one was a lot easier to understand than the arrays one!
